Our project, Twitter Analysis on the PUV Modernization Program, aims to study Twitter data related to the issue. It attempts to analyze and understand the general opinion and perspective of people about the PUV Modernization Program.

## Overview

The PUV Modernization Program has been one of the relevant issues in the Philippines. Not only has it affected PUV drivers, but also commuters which encompasses the majority of the people. Numerous strikes were held in hopes of the government and drivers to have an agreement regarding this, which affected commuters. With this, we have decided to study the general reaction of the people regarding the issue which can provide insights on how the program is perceived by them.

## Problem

### Background

On June 19 2017, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) issued Department Order No. 2017-011, otherwise known as the Omnibus Guidelines on the Planning and Identification of Public Road Transportation Services and Franchise Issuance which launched the PUVMP (Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program).

The program aims to transform the road sector of public transport through the introduction of safer and climate-friendly vehicles, improved regulation, and industry consolidation. The program is beneficial in the long run however operators are caught in a difficult situation due to the high cost of the program. According to the Office of Transportation Cooperatives, jeepney operators must raise P300,000 in paid-up capital. Operators may have to spend between P20,000 to P30,000 each to comply with other requirements. Under the Omnibus Franchising Guidelines, cooperatives and corporations will also be required to eventually upgrade their fleet into modern jeepneys, which can cost up to P2.5 million per unit.

The program would surely improve public transportation however, jeepney drivers and operators – who already subsist on low wages – must then work to pay off millions in debt and interest.

### Research Question

## Materials and Methods

### Collection

Due to recent modifications to X/Twitter's API, the data collection tool SNScrape has exhibited limitations in retrieving data effectively. So instead, we employed a manual Twitter scraping approach targeting a minimum of 1000 tweets from 2022 to the present (2024) encompassing keywords directly relevant to the research topic.

### Pre-processing

Collected tweets underwent rigorous pre-processing to ensure quality. This includes removing duplicates, non-text content, and formatting inconsistencies. The pre-processed data also underwent validation checks to ensure consistency and adherence to the defined criteria for inclusion.

### Exploration

After collection and pre-processing, the data will undergo exploratory analysis to gain insights into tweet content, distribution of keywords, and potential presence of outliers. This initial exploration will inform subsequent data cleaning and analysis strategies.
